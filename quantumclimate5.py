# Simulate Climate Data - use output from QRNG to simulate simple climate-related data, like temperature fluctuations or precipitation levels. This step involves mapping the random numbers to a range that represents the chosen data type.

#Execute the Circuit: Run the circuit on a quantum simulator:
# Use Aer's qasm_simulator
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

# Loop for Multiple Series - if you prefer to collect multiple series of random bits (each series from a separate execution of the circuit)
# Example: Collect 10 series of random bits
num_series = 10
all_counts = []

# Print all collected series

# Convert Bitstrings to Decimal
# Example conversion of bitstrings to decimal numbers
decimal_values = [int(list(count.keys())[0], 2) for count in all_counts]

# Map Decimal Values to Temperature Range
# Decide on a temperature range for your simulation. For example, let's say you want to simulate temperatures between -10°C and 30°C.
# You'll map the decimal values to this range. The formula for mapping one range to another is:
# new_value = (max_new - min_new) / (max_old - min_old) * (old_value - min_old) + min_new
# Define your temperature range
min_temp = -10
max_temp = 30

# Calculate the mapped temperature values
temperatures = [((max_temp - min_temp) / (2**num_qubits - 1)) * value + min_temp for value in decimal_values]

# Step 4: Use the Temperatures in Your Simulation
# Now that you have a list of temperature values derived from your QRNG, you can use these in your climate model simulation. For example, you might simulate how daily average temperatures fluctuate over a period, or how temperatures in different regions compare.

# Step 4A: Define Simulation Parameters
# First, decide on the duration of your simulation and the granularity of time steps. In this example, we'll simulate temperature fluctuations over 30 days with daily granularity.
num_days = 30  # Duration of the simulation in days

# Step 4B: Prepare Temperature Data
# Ensure your list of temperature values is ready for use. If the list of temperatures from your QRNG is shorter than the number of days in your simulation, you may need to loop through the temperature values or generate more data to match the simulation duration.
# Assuming 'temperatures' is your list of QRNG-derived temperature values
if len(temperatures) < num_days:
    # Repeat the temperature list to match the duration of the simulation
    temperatures = (temperatures * (num_days // len(temperatures) + 1))[:num_days]

# Step 4C: Simulate Daily Temperature Fluctuations
# For each day in your simulation, use a temperature value from your list to represent the daily average temperature. You can also introduce variability around this daily average to simulate daily fluctuations.
import random

# Introduce a daily fluctuation range (e.g., +/- 5 degrees)
fluctuation_range = 5

# Simulate daily temperatures with fluctuations
daily_temperatures = [temp + random.uniform(-fluctuation_range, fluctuation_range) for temp in temperatures]

# Step 4D: Analyze or Visualize the Simulation Results
# After simulating the daily temperatures, you can analyze the results to identify trends, anomalies, or other insights. Visualization can be particularly effective in presenting the outcomes of your simulation.
# Visualize the daily temperature fluctuations
